## ***Dummy shopping list***


<p align="left">It was a really fun experience to build a small dummy project using AI on top of React + Vite. The idea came to me quickly. 
I’d long wanted a convenient shopping list app on my phone, but I never got around to downloading a ready-made one. 
To my surprise, I ended up with a fully working product that I actually still use to this day! 
The code, though, is completely unreadable for humans: no structure, no components. 
At the time I started the project, I only had basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though the entire project was generated by AI. 
Even though the project was entirely generated by AI, I still learned something: the whole process was educational and gave me a huge amount of joy.</p>
